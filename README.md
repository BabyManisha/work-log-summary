# Work-Log-Summary
This repository automatically logs and summarizes my GitHub commits and pull requests every 30 minutes. It provides a convenient way to track my recent activity and see what I've worked on throughout the day.

## Features
- **Automated Updates:** The repository is updated every 30 minutes with a summary of recent commits and pull requests.
- **Summary Log:** Each update includes a summary of the commit messages and pull request titles.
- **Easy Tracking:** Quickly review your recent activity without navigating through multiple repositories.

## How It Works
A GitHub Action workflow runs every 30 minutes to:

1. Fetch recent commits and pull requests from your GitHub profile.
2. Generate a summary of the activity.
3. Commit and push the summary to this repository.

## Setup

   - Select the following scopes:
     - `repo`: For accessing private repositories.
     - `read:org`: If you want to access repositories under an organization.
   - Set an expiration date for the token (e.g., 90 days).
   - Click **Generate token** and copy the token.

2. **Add the PAT to Repository Secrets:**
   - Navigate to your repository's **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
   - Click **New repository secret**.
   - Add a new secret:
     - **Name:** `PAT`
     - **Value:** Paste the copied PAT token.
   - Save the secret.
